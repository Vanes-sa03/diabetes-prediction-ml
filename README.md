# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the presence of diabetes in women using different machine learning methods. We utilized a dataset containing medical information from 15,000 patients, analyzed the data, and tested multiple models to identify the best-performing one.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter Notebooks containing exploratory data analysis and model training (`EDA - Taipei.ipynb`, `EDA_Niki_diabetes.ipynb`).
- `webapp/` : Web application code for making predictions.
- `data/` : Dataset used for model training (not included if confidential).
- `report/` : Detailed project report (`report.pdf`).
- `demo/` : Video demonstration of the project.
- `requirements.txt` : List of required Python libraries.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution and impact of variables on diabetes.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
3. **Model Training**: Comparing different classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, etc.).
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing key metrics (Accuracy, Recall, AUC, etc.).
5. **Deployment**: Developing a web application for making real-time predictions.

## Installation & Execution
### **1Ô∏è) Clone the repository**
